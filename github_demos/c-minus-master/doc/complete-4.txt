STUDENT:     Ben Fowler
NUMBER:      02251132
SUBJECT:     ITB464 Modern Compiler Construction
ASSESSMENT:  Assignment 4 - Code Generator for C- Compiler


  This assignment is complete, and is entirely my own work, save for
code fragments borrowed from Louden's Tiny C example compiler.  All
tasks required for this assignment have been completed to the best of
my knowlege, and at this stage, the code compiles and executes without
apparent errors.

  Code generation has shown to be working on the examples out of Louden
(euclud.cm and selection.cm) and additionally, the compiler compiles a small
test battery of programs written by the author, all without apparent error.

  To recap, everything in this solution, including unknown defects are
entirely my own work.
