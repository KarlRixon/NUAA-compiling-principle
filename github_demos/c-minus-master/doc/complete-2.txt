STATEMENT OF COMPLETENESS
-------------------------

STUDENT:     Ben Fowler
NUMBER:      02251132
SUBJECT:     ITB464 Modern Compiler Construction
ASSESSMENT:  Assignment 2 - Predictive Parser for C-minus.


This assignment is complete, and is entirely my own work, save for code
 fragments borrowed from Louden's Tiny C example compiler.  All tasks required
 for this assignment have been completed to the best of my knowlege, and at
 this stage, the code compiles and executes without apparent errors.

The grammar has been transformed to remove left recusion, and left factoring
 has been applied on the "call" and "var" nonterminals.  The author encountered
 a minor issue with correctly parsing "expression", and came up with a solution
 of passing parsed ident_stmt tree fragments down the parse tree to bypass the
 problem.

Apart from this minor issue, the code submitted performs it's job in a swift
 and robust manner.  The output of the compiler has also checked for issues
 such as incorrect dangling-else handling, order-of-precedence and associativity and the parser appears to generate correct syntax trees for all code presented
 to the compiler.
