STATEMENT OF COMPLETENESS

STUDENT:     Ben Fowler
NUMBER:      02251132
SUBJECT:     ITB464 Modern Compiler Construction
ASSESSMENT:  Assignment 3 - Semantic Analysis for C-minus.


    This assignment is complete, and is entirely my own work, save for
code fragments borrowed from Louden's Tiny C example compiler.  All
tasks required for this assignment have been completed to the best of
my knowlege, and at this stage, the code compiles and executes without
apparent errors.

    In particular, it should be noted that proper scoping rules are
enforced in the compiler: if a variable is declared inside a
compound-statement, it will only be visible inside that compound
statement.

    One minor issue that needs pointing out is that functionality to
record line numbers where identifiers are used has been omitted.  This
functionality is not needed for code generation for semantic analysis.
However, the compiler tracks other pieces of information: in
particular for identifiers, which are tagged if they're formal
parameters to functions.  

    Another minor issue is that the symbol table is output
scope-by-scope progressively as the syntax tree is traversed during
the construction of the symbol table.  This may result in error
messages being interleaved with the symbol table listing generated by
the "TraceAnalyse" option.

    Note that several refinements have been made to the symbol table
output code as well.  See the sample output for further details.

  To recap, everything in this solution, including unknown defects are
entirely my own work.
